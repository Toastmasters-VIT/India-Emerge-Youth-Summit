Tomorrow is a realm ruled by and catering to the individuals with a drive to achieve and accomplish the extraordinary. The summit aspires to provide such driven individuals bringing about change in the world with an interactive platform to share their experiences with the makers of tomorrow.</p>
<p>From the powerfully persuasive Martin Luther King Jr. who inspired a revolution through his words, to the minds at Bell Labs at AT&T who prepared the first satellite phone, mankind has always been blessed with an assortment of change makers who continue to dream of a tomorrow with a brighter future. Following in such great examples, we as organizers of this summit recognize that each of us offers something unique to the society. We began our work in 2012 with our inaugural conference, where we inspired many students to work towards becoming a part of policies that govern our society. We then progressed to IEYS 2013, aiming at giving that very zeal some direction with the theme <i>Corruption and Contemporary India</i>.</p>
<p>IEYS 2014 will be conducted in September, at the Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore. VIT University has, since the start, been an ardent supporter of creative innovations and path-breaking projects. It shall once again open up its gates and welcome intelligent and experienced speakers to enthrall an audience of learners and shapers.</p>
<p>The world of tomorrow is for all of us, but only those who dare to bring it into existence are the ones that can be responsible for it. It is time to bring back the future. It is time to Realize, Reflect and Reinvent.</p>

						<h2>TOASTMASTERS VIT</h2>
						<p>Toastmasters International is a leading movement devoted to making effective oral com-munication a world-wide reality. Through its member clubs, it helps men and women learn the arts of speaking, listening, and thinking vital skills that promote self-actualization, en-hance leadership potential, foster human understanding, and contribute to the betterment of mankind. It was founded by Ralph C Smedley on October 22, 1924, at the YMCA in San-tana, United States. It was then incorporated under California law on December 19, 1932. Currently, it is home to 2,80,000 members spread across 116 countries.</p>
<p>A Toastmasters club adopts a "learn-by-doing" philosophy, wherein each member learns at a pace suitable to his or her developmental needs. The Toastmasters program is divided into two separate tracks - Communication and Leadership, with members progressing along each track by presenting speeches and taking on roles within their club, district, and Toastmasters International itself. The heart of the Toastmasters curriculum is leadership development and it also strength-ens one's leadership qualities. This is motivated in part by the fact that Toastmasters Inter-national is staffed completely by volunteers. Even the board of directors is composed of volunteers, who still hold memberships in local clubs, and are not paid. Toastmasters awards its highest honour, Distinguished Toastmaster (DTM), to members who have achieved both the Advanced Communication Gold and Advanced Leader Silver awards. To achieve the DTM typically takes five to eight years of dedicated service and leadership in at the local club, area, and division levels.</p>
<p>Toastmasters International is continually expanding its worldwide network of member clubs, hereby offering ever greater numbers of people the opportunity to benefit from its program.</p>
